## How to set up locally

### Prerequisites
- Please make sure "yarn" is installed on your system
- clone the git repo
##

 1. Install the dependencies 
```bash 
$ yarn 
```
2. Run the development server 
```bash 
$ yarn dev 
```
3. Generate the Prisma Client 
Then, run the development server: 
```bash 
$ yarn Prisma generate 
```  
Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

## 

  

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

  

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
